Pwnee is a Java-based 2D game engine using Java's AWT and Swing libraries. 

I'll eventually get around to expanding this README and creating some example applications. 
Hang in there until then!

All components and examples of Pwnee unless otherwise specified, have been developed and tested
on a 64-bit computer running Windows 7.

Requirements:
----------------
You'll need the following tools to be able to compile and run Pwnee and its examples:
* At least Java 6 JDK and JRE
* Adobe Ant
